# bhagavan_skyflower_parmahamsa_german_languages_acquisition_dialects_and_registers

Repository for acquiring German languages proper, major dialects, and usage registers.

## Scope
- Standard German (Hochdeutsch) for reference
- Key dialect groups: Alemannic/Schwäbisch (incl. Swiss), Bairisch-Österreichisch, Low German (Plattdeutsch), Mittel-/Rheinfränkisch (e.g., Kölsch), Berlinerisch/Norddeutsch regiolects
- Registers to capture: formal/official (Amtssprache), standard conversational, informal/familiar, youth/slang where appropriate

## Workflow
1) Collect short texts or audio references per dialect and register.
2) Note pronunciation/orthography specifics and glosses into dialect/register-aligned notes.
3) Track vocabulary and idioms with standard German equivalents.
4) Practice with example sentences and minimal pairs for sound shifts.

## Repository layout
- `/notes/` for dialect + register notes (to be filled as material is gathered)
- `/lexicon/` for comparative vocab lists
- `/exercises/` for practice sentences and drills

Add materials incrementally; keep entries labeled by dialect and register to make acquisition focused and searchable.
